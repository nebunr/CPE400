# CPE400 
Project by Benjamin Estela, Sidney Inouye, and Jonathon Hewitt.
## Topic (#2)
Dynamic routing mechanism design with focus on energy conservation.
## Description
Create and simulate a sensor network. The objective is to increase the longevity of the network by using dynamic routing. Sensors are energy constrained and are not super powerful like common computers. Every time a sensor transmits some packets, it will decrease the amount of energy left. The team will create a dynamic routing scheme to try and maintain all nodes of the network online for as long as possible.
