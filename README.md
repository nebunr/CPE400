## Topic (#2)
Dynamic routing mechanism design with focus on energy conservation.

## Description
![projectInfo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30031065/69931871-b9451000-147d-11ea-8a64-1d8bc6c2a93f.png)  

Create and simulate a sensor network. The objective is to increase the longevity of the network by using dynamic routing. Sensors are energy constrained and are not super powerful like common computers. Every time a sensor transmits some packets, it will decrease the amount of energy left. The team will create a dynamic routing scheme to try and maintain all nodes of the network online for as long as possible.
